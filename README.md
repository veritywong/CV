## Verity Wong

I am an aspirational software developer, artist, ceramicist; a maker with a passion for learning how things work and using this knowledge to create through collaboration. 

I have spent the past 10 years building my career in the arts, through teaching, workshop facilitation, leading community projects, teaching myself to become a professional ceramicist and co-founding a successful art collective. 

I am ready for new challenges and eager to learn about tech, which is why I have enrolled in the Makers course. I am excited to see how this journey unfolds.

## Skills

#### Communication
I am able to communicate clearly by breaking down information into easily digestible chunks. I have learnt and developed this skill through my degree in History of Art; in my final dissertation I achieved a high first as a result of my ability to introduce, explain and analyse academic concepts. This has also been an important skill in my teaching, where I have demonstrated activities clearly, concisely and thoroughly so my students feel safe and confident to participate in the workshop. This has been especially necessary in my work teaching children and adults with learning disabilities.

#### Fast Learner

I find fulfilment in learning. I can learn new concepts and techniques in a systematic and thorough way, which enables me to apply what I have learnt. I am always improving and looking to develop my skills and expertise. I am also aware of how I learn best, giving me the ability to achieve highly in whatever I apply myself to. 

Most recently I co-produced, shot and edited a film, learning how to use new equipment and software and creating a digital art piece, which is now on show at Royal Museums Greenwich.

#### Problem Solver

I love to solve problems. Whether it is in the new challenges and exercises being introduced at Makers, or simply playing sudoku on the train home. 

In my ceramics practice, this is an integral part of creating functional work. Ceramics entails a long process, where each stage can introduce new problems into the final piece, from reclaiming clay, preparing the clay, throwing, firing, glazing and final firing. Each stage requires different skills and knowledge and if anything goes wrong it can have occurred at any one of these stages. This requires problem solving that involves researching materials, chemistry, analysing each step as well ask knowing when to step back and view the process as a whole. I love it. 

#### Team Player

In a group I am encouraging, positive and supportive. I have spent my life working with others, and I have seen the incredible outcomes that occur when people come together. I have run therapeutic art classes for people experiencing mental ill health and I have seen the benefits first hand of how positive group dynamics bring out the best in people and enable them to create in ways they would never have expected. In one such project the group went from almost no experience of painting, to creating a large scale group mural to be displayed outside Forest Hill Station. 

#### Self Motivated

As a freelance artist I have had to run every part of my business; producing new work, writing project proposals, applying for funding, liaising with other organisations and artists,  social media, administration, writing budgets, bookkeeping and filing end of year accounts. The work and experience I gain relies on my ability be self motivated and self directed. In order to have worked in the arts I have been able to manage these areas of my business to a high level.
