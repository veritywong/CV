## Verity Wong

Software Developer, artist, ceramicist; my lifelong passion for learning and a curiosity for how things work has led me to a new career in tech. I am both an analytical and creative thinker with a love of problem solving; coding has given me the opportunity to work to these skills and strengths. I am looking for a job as a junior developer, to bring my enthusiasm and developing skills to this exciting field.

## Experience

**Makers Academy** (April '23 to July '23)
_Student_

- An intensive and immersive coding bootcamp, teaching the fundamentals of building, testing, debugging and refactoring to create full stack web apps. 
- Test driven development has taught me a clear and systematic way to approach code, starting with the simplest aspects of a given programme and building the complexity from there. It has resulted in clean and efficient code.
- Growth mindset has been a key factor in the learning process, and has enabled me to learn new concepts and languages effectively during the course. The opportunities for constant learning have been hugely enjoyable and exciting.
- Pair programming and group projects using Agile methodologies have been an important part of the course. Excellent communication and positive collaboration have been important, allowing for good ticket creation and a cohesive and shared approach to building the apps. It also developed my skills using Git and Github to ensure good systems for merging new functions.
- OOP, TDD, MVC
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, JavaScript, NodeJS, SQL
- RSpec, Jest, Cypress
  
**Freelance Artist & Ceramicist** (2003 to Present)  
_Artist_

- Ceramicist - Excellent planning and organising in order to run a workshop space, which includes buying materials, maintaining equipment, creating work, firing and glazing.
- Ceramics requires excellent problem solving skills, and a continuous learning of new techniques. When completed work has ended up with certain glaze problems I have been able to locate the source of the error and adjust my methods to produce consistently high level work.
- Artist as part of the art collective JIUN. Collaborative working, excellent communication skills and learning new processes necessary for different projects. Most recently we created and edited a film for the first time, which is now exhibited at the Royal Museums Greenwich.


**Sydenham Garden** (2021 to 2022)  
_Art and Craft Project Assistant_

- Planning, running and reviewing therapeutic workshops for people recovering from mental ill health.
- Volunteer management and coordination, creating a supportive environment for volunteers, maintained a brilliant team of committed volunteers.
- Excellent interpersonal skills; solving problems that occur and providing thoughtful solutions to challenges. Improved the mental health of participants, monitored through regular one to one reviews and questionnaires.


**The Conservatoire** (2006 to 2021)  
_Art Tutor_

- Teaching and developing art classes for children and young people.
- Planning and creative ideation to think of interesting workshops that would suit a range of ages and abilities.
- Required excellent communication and problem solving skills when working with children with different learning needs. I was able to work with these children well, with children returning every term to my classes.


## Skills

#### Communication
I am able to communicate clearly by breaking down information into easily digestible chunks. I have learnt and developed this skill through my degree in History of Art; in my final dissertation I achieved a high first as a result of my ability to introduce, explain and analyse academic concepts. This has also been an important skill in my teaching, where I have demonstrated activities clearly, concisely and thoroughly so my students feel safe and confident to participate in the workshop. This has been especially necessary in my work teaching children and adults with learning disabilities.

#### Fast Learner

I find fulfilment in learning. I can learn new concepts and techniques in a systematic and thorough way, which enables me to apply what I have learnt. I am always improving and looking to develop my skills and expertise. I am also aware of how I learn best, giving me the ability to achieve highly in whatever I apply myself to. 

Most recently I co-produced, shot and edited a film, learning how to use new equipment and software and creating a digital art piece, which is now on show at Royal Museums Greenwich.

#### Problem Solver

I love to solve problems. Whether it is in the new challenges and exercises introduced at Makers and in writing code, or simply playing sudoku on the train home. 

In my ceramics practice, this is an integral part of creating functional work. Ceramics entails a long process, where each stage can introduce new problems into the final piece, from reclaiming clay, preparing the clay, throwing, firing, glazing and final firing. Each step requires different skills and knowledge and if anything goes wrong it can have occurred at any one of these stages. This requires problem solving that involves researching materials, analysing each step as well ask knowing when to step back and view the process as a whole. I love it. 

#### Team Player

In a group I am encouraging, positive and supportive. I have spent my life working with others, and I have seen the incredible outcomes that occur when people come together. I have run therapeutic art classes for people experiencing mental ill health and I have seen the benefits first hand of how positive group dynamics bring out the best in people and enable them to create in ways they would never have expected. In one such project the group went from almost no experience of painting, to creating a large scale group mural to be displayed outside Forest Hill Station. 

#### Self Motivated

As a freelance artist I have had to run every part of my business; producing new work, writing project proposals, liaising with other organisations and artists,  social media, administration, writing budgets, bookkeeping and filing end of year accounts. The work and experience I gain relies on my ability be self motivated and self directed. In order to have worked in the arts I have been able to manage these areas of my business to a high level.
